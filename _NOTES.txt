Notes on loading movies to iPod Nano
Jul 26 2016

iPod Nano is 3rd Gen

Movies must be 360x240 (1.333/4:3), I think can be MPEG4 or H264, AAC audio

iTunesU stuff downloaded to:
~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/iTunes\ U

Move files to:
~/work/Personal/iTunes
since iTunes manages it's area and tries to undo changes that I might make

Convert a 480x270 (1.777/16:9) movie for Nano, with letterboxing:
ffmpeg -i Lecture\ 3_\ Basic\ Strategy.mp4 -vcodec mpeg4 -filter:v "scale=320:180, pad=320:240:0:30" -acodec copy ./Lecture\ 3_\ Basic\ Strategy\ IPOD.mp4

iTunes looks at metadata for iTunesU course and won't allow files to be transferred, even if converted

Need to move/copy movie files for course, convert with ffmpeg, then add to ipod into movies area
Don't have to move/copy - can work in iTunes area but iTunes does a lot of automated management in there
Can delete files from iTunes course area, and even entire course when done

Can rename move (eg to keep course lectures together) in iTunes after movie is copied onto Nano with Get Info
Probably could also do by altering meta-data in file
Seems to get name from meta-data, not filename

can get metadata from file with (barfs a bunch of stuff out on stderr too):
set md = `ffmpeg -i Lecture\ 2_\ Analytical\ Techniques.mp4 -f ffmetadata -`

can get info on file with
ffmpeg -i <file>

A few iTunesU course movies are old enough (ca. 2008) that they can be put directly onto Nano with iTunes
MIT - Photography as Sensing Place, most other MIT won't work
Stanford - old Engineering and Math courses
Not Yale - all the old courses I viewed look like they've been reprocessed and won't work any more

see conv.csh for script to do conversions

Other conversion commands:

Rescale (causes distortion going from 16:9 to 4:3):
ffmpeg -i Lecture\ 3_\ Basic\ Strategy.mp4 -vcodec mpeg4 -s 320x240 -aspect 4:3 -acodec copy ./Lecture\ 3_\ Basic\ Strategy\ IPOD.mp4

Resamples audio, sets frame rate to 15 - none of this is needed:
ffmpeg -i ~/work/Personal/iTunes/Lecture\ 3_\ Basic\ Strategy.mp4 -vcodec mpeg4 -acodec libvo_aacenc -ar 22050 -s 320x240 -aspect 4:3 -r 15 ./Lecture\ 3_\ Basic\ Strategy.mp4
